# Project Diary


## Day 1: CHAOS!
- changing tables, changing chairs, changing everything.
- Immoweb will be our home for the week


- trello? github pages? nothing?
- settle on a structure first?
- let's use a generator!
- already on immoweb, inspecting the html
- APIs? No APIs? Public, private, paid, hidden?!
- what verison of Python are we using?

BREAK!

"We have a whole week, we can afford taking a full day to look at this individually and re-group tomorrow morning." "Yes, then we cal all say how we want to approach this." "No, how about working in a team!?"

Aaaaaargh!!!
