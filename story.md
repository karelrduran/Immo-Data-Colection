# Project Diary


## Day 1: CHAOS! 😱

First team project! what!? 

- changing tables, changing chairs
- immoweb.be is our home for the week
- trello? github pages? scrum? nothing?
- settle on a structure first? just dive in?
- let's use a generator! huh?!
- already inspecting the html !!
- to API or not to API? that is the question 
- APIs: public, private, paid, hidden?!
- what version of Python are we all using?

### **--- Project status after day 1**: Aaaaaargh!!! 


## Day 2: PROGRESS! 🚀 

-- tasks arise organically -- 

**Em** → parses immoweb search results pages to get a list of unique property URLs\
**Alice** → parses a unique hmtl page to get the required property data\
**Karel** → creates project repo & project skeleton with file structure, modules & classes\
**Gerrit** → explores alternative route to scraping the property data using Scrapy\

### **--- Project status after day2**: Everybody has something to do… 

## Day 3: NO STRESS? 😶

**Gerrit** → “we’re done, right? I’ll go & see if I can help other ppl”\
**Alice** →  “think we should continue to work individually, I’m trying out some other stuff”\
**Karel** → “I will show you what I did with Scrapy”\
**Em** → “but there’s no MVP, doesn’t look like we’re done. ok, I’ll work on my own solution”\
