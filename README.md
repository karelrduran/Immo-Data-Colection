## 📖 Description
This Scraper is designed to collect data on real estate properties across Belgium to aid in the development of a machine learning model for price prediction.

Features:

- Scrapes real estate listings from the largest Belgian real estate website
- Builds a dataset with detailed property information
- Saves data in both JSON and CSV formats for further analysis

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

- create a new virtual environment by executing this command in your terminal:
`python3 -m venv wikipedia_scraper_env`
- activate the environment by executing this command in your terminal:
`source wikipedia_scraper_env/bin/activate`
- install the required dependencies by executing this command in your terminal:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 👩‍💻 Usage
To run the program, clone this repo on your local machine, navigate to its directory in your terminal, make sure you have first executed your requirements.txt, then execute:

```
python3 main.py
```

## Visuals

Step 1 - a csv file with ~19,000 unique property urls
Step 2 - a json file with
Step 3 - a csv file with 


## 📂 Project background & timeline

This scraping project was done over the course of one week in February 2024. It is the first stage of a larger team project in the AI Bootcamp to build a machine learning model that predicts the price of real estate properties in Belgium.

The project's output is a dataset containing information about at least 10000 properties all over Belgium.
This dataset will be later used to train a prediction model.
